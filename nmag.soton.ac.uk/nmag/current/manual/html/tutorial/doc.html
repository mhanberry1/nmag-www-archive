<p>This section is intended for researchers who are just beginning to
explore micromagnetic modelling. It is assumed that you have some
knowledge on micromagnetics. We advise to read this whole section, and
then to look the <a class="reference internal" href="../guided_tour.html#guided-tour"><em>Guided Tour</em></a> examples (or to explore other
<a class="reference internal" href="doc.html#micromagnetic-packages"><em>Micromagnetic packages</em></a> at that point).</p>
<div class="section" id="introduction-micromagnetic-modelling">
<span id="id2"></span><h2>11.1. Introduction micromagnetic modelling<a class="headerlink" href="doc.html#introduction-micromagnetic-modelling" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>To carry out micromagnetic simulations, a set of partial differential
equations have to be solved repeatedly. In order to be able to do
this, the simulated geometry has to be spatially discretised. The two
methods that are most widely spread in micromagnetic modelling are the
so-called finite difference (FD) method and the finite element (FE)
method. With either the FD or the FE method, we need to integrate the
Landau-Lifshitz and Gilbert equation numerically over time (this is a
coupled set of ordinary differential equations). All these
calculations are carried out by the <a class="reference internal" href="doc.html#micromagnetic-packages"><em>Micromagnetic packages</em></a> and the
user does not have to worry about these.</p>
<p>The finite difference method subdivides space into many small
cuboids. Sometimes the name <em>cell</em> is used to describe one of these
cuboids. (Warning: in finite difference simulations, the simulated
geometry is typically enclosed by a (big) cuboid which is also
referred to as <em>simulation cell</em>. Usually (!) it is clear from the
context which is meant.)  Typically, all simulation cells in one
finite difference simulation have the same geometry. A typical size
for such a cell could be a cube of dimensions 3nm by 3nm by 3nm.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s assume we would like to simulate a sphere. The following picture</p>
<img alt="../_images/fd.png" class="align-center" src="../_images/fd.png" style="width: 200px; height: 180px;" />
<p>shows an approximation of the shape of the sphere by cubes. This is
the finite difference approach. For clarity, we have chosen rather
large cubes to resolve the sphere &#8211; in an actual simulation one would
typically use a much smaller cell size in order to resolve geometry
better.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the finite element method (typically) subdivides
space into many small tetrahedra. The tetrahedra are sometimes
referred to as the (finite element) mesh elements. Typically, the
geometry of these tetrahedra does vary throughout the simulated
region. This allows to combine the tetrahedra to approximate
complicated geometries.</p>
<p>Using tetrahedra, the a discretised sphere looks like this:</p>
<img alt="../_images/fe.png" class="align-center" src="../_images/fe.png" style="width: 200px; height: 186px;" />
<p>The spherical shape is approximated better than with the finite
differences.</p>
<p>The first step in setting up a micromagnetic simulation is to describe
the geometry. In the case of finite difference calculations, it will
depend on the package you use (currently there is only <a class="reference external" href="http://math.nist.gov/oommf/">OOMMF</a> freely
available) how to tell the package what geometry you would like to
use, and how small your simulation cells should be.</p>
<p>In the case of finite element calculations, you need to create a
finite element mesh (see <a class="reference internal" href="../finite_element_mesh_generation.html#finite-element-mesh-generation"><em>Finite element mesh generation</em></a>).</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="what-is-better-finite-differences-or-finite-elements">
<span id="id3"></span><h2>11.2. What is better: finite differences or finite elements?<a class="headerlink" href="doc.html#what-is-better-finite-differences-or-finite-elements" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>This depends on what you want to simulate. Here are some points to consider.</p>
<ul>
<li><p class="first">Finite difference simulations are best when the geometry you
simulate is of rectangular shape (i.e. a cube, a beam, a geometry
composed of such objects, a T profile, etc). In these situations,
the finite element discretisation of the geometry will not yield any
advantage. (Assuming that the finite difference grid is aligned with
the edges in the geometry.)</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Finite difference simulations need generally less computer memory
(RAM). This is in particular the case if you simulate geometries
with a big surface (such as thin films). See <a class="reference internal" href="../executables.html#memory-requirements-of-boundary-element-matrix"><em>Memory requirements of boundary element matrix</em></a> for a description of the memory
requirements of the hybrid finite element/boundary element simulations (both
Nmag and <a class="reference external" href="http://www.magpar.net/">Magpar</a> are in this category).</p>
<p>If this turns out to be a problem for you, we suggest to read the section
<a class="reference internal" href="../example_phi_BEM_hlib/doc.html#compression-of-the-boundary-element-matrix-using-hlib"><em>Compression of the Boundary Element Matrix using HLib</em></a>.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Finite element simulations are best suited to describe geometries
with some amount of curvature, or angles other than 90 degrees. For
such simulations, there is an error associated with the staircase
discretisation that finite difference approaches have to use. This
error is very much reduced when using finite elements.</p>
<p>(We state for completeness that there are techniques to reduce the
staircase effect in finite difference simulations but these are
currently not available in open source micromagnetic simulation
code.)</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">For finite element simulations, the user has to create a finite
element mesh. This requires some practice (mostly to get used to a
meshing package), and in practice will take a significant amount of
the time required to set up a finite element simulation.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="what-size-of-the-cells-fd-and-tetrahedra-fe-should-i-choose">
<span id="id4"></span><h2>11.3. What size of the cells (FD) and tetrahedra (FE) should I choose?<a class="headerlink" href="doc.html#what-size-of-the-cells-fd-and-tetrahedra-fe-should-i-choose" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>There are several things to consider:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>the smaller the cells or tetrahedra, the more accurate the
simulation results.</li>
<li>the smaller the cells or tetrahedra, the more cells and tetrahedra
are required to describe a geometry. Memory requirements and
execution time increase with the number of cells and tetrahedra. In
practice this will limit the size of the system that can be
simulated.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p class="first">the discretisation length (this is the edge length of the cells or
the tetrahedra) should be <em>much smaller than the exchange
length</em>. The reason for this is that in the derivation of the
micromagnetic (Brown&#8217;s) equations, one assumes that the
magnetisation changes little in space (there is a Taylor expansion
for the exchange interaction). Therefore, we need to choose a
discretisation length so that the direction of the magnetisation
vectors varies little from one site (cell center in FD, node of
tetrahedron in FE) to the next. The difference of the magnetisation
vector is sometimes referred to as the &#8216;spin angle&#8217;: a spin angle of
0 degrees, means that the magnetisation at neighbouring sites points
in the same direction, whereas a spin angle of 180 degrees would mean
that they point in exactly opposite directions.</p>
<p>How much variation is acceptable, i.e. how big is the spin angle
allowed to be? It depends on the accuracy required. Some general
guidelines from M. Donahue [in email to H. Fangohr on 26 March
2002 referring to OOMMF] which we fully endorse :</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">[Begin</span> <span class="pre">quote</span> <span class="pre">M.</span> <span class="pre">Donahue]</span></tt></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>if the spin angle is approaching 180 degrees, then the results are
completely bogus.</li>
<li>over 90 degrees the results are highly questionable.</li>
<li>Under 30 degrees the results are probably reliable.</li>
</ul>
<p><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">[end</span> <span class="pre">quote]</span></tt></p>
<p>It is <em>absolutely vital</em> that the spin angle does not become
excessive if the simulation results are to be trusted. (It is
probably the most common error in micromagnetics: one would like to
simulate a large geometry, thus one has to choose the discretisation
length large to get any results within reasonable time. However, the
results are often completely useless if the spin angle becomes too
large).</p>
<p>Because this is such an important issue, OOMMF &#8211; for example &#8211;
provides <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Max</span> <span class="pre">Spin</span> <span class="pre">Ang</span></tt> data in its <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">odt</span></tt> data table file (for
the current configuration, the last stage, and the overall
run). Nmag has a columns <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">maxangle_m_X</span></tt> in the <a class="reference internal" href="../files_and_file_names.html#ndt"><em>Data files (.ndt)</em></a> file that
provide this information (where <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">X</span></tt> is the name of the magnetic
material).</p>
<p>You will probably find that often a discretisation length of half
the <a class="reference internal" href="doc.html#exchange-length"><em>Exchange length</em></a> or even about the <a class="reference internal" href="doc.html#exchange-length"><em>Exchange length</em></a> is
chosen. If the spin angle stays sufficiently low during the whole
simulation (including intermediate non-equilibrium configurations),
then this may be acceptable.</p>
<p>The ultimate test (recommended by &#8211; among others &#8211; M. Donahue and the
nmag team) is the following:</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">cell size dependence test</p>
<p>The best way to check whether the cell size has been chosen small
enough, is to perform a series of simulations with increasing cell
size. Suppose we are simulating Permalloy (Ni80Fe20 with Ms=8e5 A/m,
A=1.3e-11) and the <a class="reference internal" href="doc.html#exchange-length"><em>Exchange length</em></a> l<sub>1</sub> is about 5nm. Suppose further
we would like to use a cell size of 5nm for our simulations.</p>
<p>We should then carry out the same simulation with smaller cell
sizes, for example, 4nm, 3nm, 2nm, 1nm. Now we need to study
(typically plot) some (scalar) entity of the simulation (such as
the coercive field, or the remanence magnetisation) as a function of
the cell size.</p>
<p>Ideally, this entity should converge towards a constant value when
we reduce the simulation cell size below a critical cell size. This
critical cell size is the maximum cell size that should be used to
carry out the simulations.</p>
<p>Be aware that (i) it is often nearly impossible to carry out these
simulations at smaller cell sizes [because of a lack of
computational power] and (ii) this method is not 100% fool proof
[the observed entity may appear to converge towards a constant but
actually start changing again if the cell size is reduced even
further].</p>
<p>One should therefore treat the suggestions made above as advise on
good practice, but never solely rely on this. Critical examination
of the validity of simulation results is a fundamental part of any
simulation work.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In summary, it is vital to keep the maximum spin angle small to obtain
accurate results. One should always (!) check the value of the spin
angle in the data files. One should also carry out a series of
simulations where the spin angle is reduced from one simulation to the
next while keeping all other parameters and the geometry the
same. This should reveal any changes in the results that depend on the
discretisation length.</p>

equation for soft materials (where the demagnetisation energy is
driving domain wall formation)</p>
